Deployment notes



Install new ruby (1.9.2 p180), and then a new rails – each ruby has its own set of gem
Can have a javascript per controller in 3.1 – improve performance – but probably not necessary
Added ckeditor gem
Rails generate ckeditor:install  - install ckeditor
Change slugignore
•	Fonts and javascript were copied under public.
- Blue is moved under public/stylesheets - so it isn't bundled into the single css file.
- Public/asset has nothing - these are created on compile
http://batsov.com/articles/2011/10/30/deploying-rails31-apps-on-celadon-cedar/   - good article on heroku deploy setting
Added in application.rb
		config.assets.initialize_on_precompile = false  - without this precompile did not work. Rails guide and others say this is required
		google analytics call
Production.rb - config.assets.compile = true  - changed from false- says so in above doc.

ckeditor spellcheck - added the following to config.js  - just * line for toolbar
  config.toolbar_Easy =
    [
        ['Source','-','Preview'],
        ['Cut','Copy','Paste','PasteText','PasteFromWord',],
        ['Undo','Redo','-','SelectAll','RemoveFormat'],
		**		['SpellChecker', 'Scayt' ],
				['Styles','Format'], ['Subscript', 'Superscript', 'TextColor'], ['Maximize','-','About'], '/',
        ['Bold','Italic','Underline','Strike'], ['NumberedList','BulletedList','-','Outdent','Indent','Blockquote'],
        ['JustifyLeft','JustifyCenter','JustifyRight','JustifyBlock'],
        ['Link','Unlink','Anchor'], ['Image', 'Attachment', 'Flash', 'Embed'],
        ['Table','HorizontalRule','Smiley','SpecialChar','PageBreak']
    ];

	// Sets SCAYT to eng.
	config.scayt_sLang = 'en_GB';

	config.scayt_autoStartup = true;
